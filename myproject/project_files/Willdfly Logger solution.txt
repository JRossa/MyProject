Eclipse, Spring, Wildfly log4j logging

 am running Spring framework 3.2.2.RELEASE on WildFly 8.0. I am trying to get logging to work. I have tried reading several tutorials, but, can not seem to get any output to the console or log. I am looking at the console in Eclipse, and the log at wildfly/standalone/log/server.log. Any help getting logging going is appreciated.
 
 SOLUTION: 
 Based on Jame's answer below, To fix this based on my setup above, I added the following to wildFly's standalone.xml, and logging works as expected:

<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:2.0">
    <use-deployment-logging-config value="false"/>
